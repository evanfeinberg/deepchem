  Binana extracts a fingerprint from a provided binding pose.

  TODO(rbharath): Write a function that extracts the binding-site residues
  and their numbers. This will prove useful when debugging the fingerprint
  for correct binding-pocket interactions.

  TODO(rbharath): Write a function that lists charged groups in
  binding-site residues.

  TODO(rbharath): Write a function that aromatic groups in
  binding-site residues.

  TODO(rbharath) Write a function that lists charged groups in ligand.

  TODO(rbharath): Write a function that lists aromatic groups in ligand.

  The Binana feature vector transforms a ligand-receptor binding pose
  into a feature vector. The feature vector has the following
  components:

    -vina_output: Components of vina's score function.
    -ligand_receptor_contacts: List of contacts between ligand and
       receptor atoms (< 4 A)
    -ligand_receptor_electrostatics: Coulomb energy between contacting
       ligand and receptor atoms.
    -ligand_atom_counts: The atom types in the ligand.
    -ligand_receptor_close_contacts: List of close contacts between
       ligand and receptor (< 2.5 A)
    -hbonds: List of hydrogen bonds.
    -hydrophobic: List of hydrophobic contacts.
    -stacking: List of pi-pi stacking.
    -pi_cation: List of pi-cation interactions.
    -t_shaped: List of T-shaped interactions.
      The pi-cloud concentrates negative charge, leaving the edges of the
      aromatic ring with some positive charge. Hence, T-shaped interactions
      align the positive exterior of one ring with the negative interior of
      another. See wikipedia for details.
    -active_site_flexibility: Considers whether the receptor atoms are
       backbone or sidechain and whether they are part of
       alpha-helices or beta-sheets.
    -salt_bridges: List of salt-bridges between ligand and receptor.
    -rotatable_bonds_count: Count of (ligand(?), receptor(?))
